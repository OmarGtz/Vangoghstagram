# Vangoghstagram Android/iOS challenge

**Please build this like you would an actual project you're working on. It should be production-ready code that you're proud of.**

We're looking for awesome engineers to join our team at Instacart.

Your goal today is to build a simple Android app with the following functionality:

* An animated welcome screen that transitions into a view that allows the user to sign into Instacart.
* An authentication screen that captures a user's email and password.
* Validate the user's credentials by making an API call.
* If either field is missing or signin fails, return a relevant error message.
* On a successful signin, store the authentication token returned from the API.

## Guidelines

* Spend a fixed amount of time building the app â€“ less than 3 hours.
* Support for Android phones 4+
* Support for tablet screensizes is a plus
* Test account: staging141508@example.com / test123

You can download the assets for the welcome splash screen [here][]. An example of the welcome screen animation can be found in the Instacart iOS app (kill the app from the background to see the animation).
