# Vangoghstagram challenge

**Please build this like you would an actual project you're working on. It should be production-ready code that you're proud of.**

Your goal today is to build a simple Android/iOS/Web app with the following functionality:

* An animated welcome screen that transitions into a view that allows the user to sign into Instagram.
* An authentication screen that captures a user's email and password.
* Use Instagram API in order to get the 5 last uploaded images.
* If either field is missing or signin fails, return a relevant error message.
* On a successful signin, store the authentication token returned from the API.
* Store the last 5 uploaded images and apply them a Post-realism filter using
TensorFlow.

## Guidelines

* Gather a team of two people maximum.
* Spend a fixed amount of time building the app â€“ less than 9 hours.
* Use your own Instagram Account for testing purposes.
* Feel free to use all assets (background images, texts) from the internetz :).
