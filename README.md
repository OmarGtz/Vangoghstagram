# Vangoghstagram challenge

**Please build this like you would an actual project you're working on. It should be production-ready code that you're proud of.**

Your goal today is to build a simple Android/iOS/Web app with the following functionality:

* An animated welcome screen that transitions into a view that allows the user to sign into Instagram.
* Use [Instagram API] in order to get the 5 last uploaded images.
* If either field is missing or signin fails, return a relevant error message.
* On a successful signin, store the authentication token returned from the API.
* Display all images using [Master-detail design pattern].
* When user clicks in the image, it display in full screen.
* Create a CSS filter for the images []
---

## Guidelines

* Gather a team of two people maximum.
* Spend a fixed amount of time building the app â€“ less than 9 hours.
* Use your own Instagram Account for testing purposes.
* Feel free to use all assets (background images, texts) from the internetz :).
---

## Extra points

* Use Zenhub [Chrome Extension].
* Use React Native for Android/iOS build.
* An authentication screen that captures a user's email and password.
* Store the last 5 uploaded images and apply them a Post-realism filter using TensorFlow.

### Android
* Use Retrofit for API calls.
* Use Material Design retrocompatibility package.
* The APK file should thinner than 10mb.
* Upload the app to Google Play.
* Use Kotlin instead Java.

### iOS
* Use RestKit for API calls.
* Use Swift instead Objective-C
* Use [Swift Package Manager]

### Web
* Use React/Angular as front-end framework.
* Use Flask/Bootstrap instead Django.
* Use Firebase instead Django.
* Implement Materialize in the front-end.
* Use a framework you are not familiar with.
